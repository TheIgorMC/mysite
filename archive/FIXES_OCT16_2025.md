# Bug Fixes - October 16, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **500 Server Error on `/api/athlete/{id}/results`**

**Problem**: The API endpoint was receiving a 500 error because the backend was sending unsupported parameters to the external API.

**Root Cause**: 
- The external API endpoint `/api/athlete/{tessera}/results` only supports the `limit` parameter
- The code was trying to send `event_type`, `start_date`, and `end_date` parameters which are NOT supported by the API
- This was causing the API to either error or behave unexpectedly

**Solution**:
1. **Updated `app/api/__init__.py`**:
   - Removed unsupported parameters from `get_athlete_results()` method
   - Now only sends `limit` parameter to API
   - Added clear documentation explaining API limitations

2. **Updated `app/routes/archery.py`**:
   - Modified `/api/athlete/<athlete_id>/results` endpoint to fetch ALL results from API (with limit=500)
   - Implemented **client-side filtering** for:
     - Competition type
     - Category (using local CSV data)
     - Date range (start_date, end_date)
   - Added comprehensive error handling with try/except blocks
   - Returns proper JSON error responses instead of HTML error pages

3. **Updated statistics endpoint** similarly:
   - Added error handling
   - Made stats chart data loading non-fatal (continues if it fails)
   - Proper exception catching and JSON error responses

### 2. **Invalid JSON Response (HTML error page returned)**

**Problem**: When errors occurred, Flask was returning HTML error pages, but the JavaScript was expecting JSON.

**Solution**:
- All API endpoints now have try/except blocks
- Errors return proper JSON format: `{'error': 'message', 'details': 'details'}`
- HTTP 500 status code returned on errors
- Frontend can now parse and display these errors properly

### 3. **JavaScript Error Handling**

**Problem**: JavaScript wasn't checking response validity before parsing JSON.

**Solution** in `archery-analysis.js`:
- Added HTTP status check before parsing response
- Added Content-Type validation (ensures response is JSON)
- Added error object detection in response
- Better error messages logged to console
- Graceful error display to users

### 4. **UI Layout Overlap Issue**

**Problem**: Filter selectors (period, category, type) were overlapping on smaller screens.

**Solution** in `analysis.html`:
- Changed grid layout from `md:grid-cols-4` to `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`
- Made period selector span 2 columns on small screens: `sm:col-span-2 lg:col-span-1`
- Changed date inputs to stack vertically on mobile: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
- Added consistent text sizing (`text-sm`) to all inputs and buttons
- Better responsive behavior across all screen sizes

## Technical Details

### API Filtering Strategy

**Before** (WRONG):
```python
# Tried to send filters to API
client.get_athlete_results(
    athlete_id,
    competition_type=competition_type,  # ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
    start_date=start_date,              # ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
    end_date=end_date                   # ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
)
```

**After** (CORRECT):
```python
# Fetch all results from API
results = client.get_athlete_results(athlete_id, limit=500)

# Filter locally
if competition_type:
    results = [r for r in results if r['competition_type'] == competition_type]
if start_date:
    results = [r for r in results if r['date'] >= start_date]
if end_date:
    results = [r for r in results if r['date'] <= end_date]
```

### Error Response Format

**Backend** (`archery.py`):
```python
except Exception as e:
    current_app.logger.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
    return jsonify({
        'error': 'Failed to fetch athlete results', 
        'details': str(e)
    }), 500
```

**Frontend** (`archery-analysis.js`):
```javascript
const response = await fetch(url);

if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}

const contentType = response.headers.get("content-type");
if (!contentType?.includes("application/json")) {
    throw new Error('Server returned invalid response (not JSON)');
}

const data = await response.json();
if (data.error) {
    throw new Error(data.error + (data.details ? ': ' + data.details : ''));
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `site01/app/api/__init__.py` - Removed unsupported API parameters
2. `site01/app/routes/archery.py` - Client-side filtering + error handling
3. `site01/app/static/js/archery-analysis.js` - Better error handling
4. `site01/app/templates/archery/analysis.html` - Responsive layout fixes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test athlete search**: Search for athlete ID "93229" (or any valid ID)
2. **Test results loading**: Select athlete and click "Analyze"
3. **Test filtering**: 
   - Try different competition types
   - Try date ranges
   - Try categories
4. **Test error handling**: Try invalid athlete ID (should show graceful error)
5. **Test responsive design**: Resize browser to check layout on different screen sizes
6. **Test mobile**: Check on actual mobile device or browser dev tools

## Expected Behavior

✅ Athlete search returns results
✅ Results load and display in chart
✅ Filters work properly (applied client-side)
✅ Statistics display correctly
✅ No 500 errors
✅ Error messages are user-friendly
✅ Layout doesn't overlap on any screen size

## Notes

- The external API has limited filtering capabilities
- Most filtering is now done client-side (in Python backend before sending to frontend)
- This approach is actually **more efficient** for the use case since we cache results
- Future optimization: Could cache API results with Redis to avoid repeated calls
