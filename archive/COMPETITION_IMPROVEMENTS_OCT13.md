# Competition Management Improvements - October 13, 2025

## Overview
Major improvements to the competition management system including UI fixes, better internationalization, athlete preference management, and improved subscription workflow.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Spinner Not Hiding
**Problem**: Loading spinner stayed visible even after competitions loaded.

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit `finally` block in `loadInitialData()` to always hide spinner
- Ensures spinner is hidden in both success and error cases

**File**: `app/templates/archery/competitions.html`

---

### 2. ✅ Added Location (Luogo) Display
**Problem**: Only showing society code instead of meaningful location information.

**Solution**:
- Updated competition card to prioritize: `luogo` → `societa_nome` → `societa_codice` → 'TBA'
- Shows full club name or city when available

**File**: `app/templates/archery/competitions.html`
```javascript
let locationText = competition.luogo || competition.societa_nome || competition.societa_codice || 'TBA';
```

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed (null) in Turn Selection
**Problem**: Turn dropdown showing "(null)" when data fields were missing.

**Solution**:
- Check each field (giorno, fase, ora_ritrovo) before displaying
- Only include non-null parts in display text
- Fallback to "Turno X" if no details available
- Use translated strings for dropdown label

**File**: `app/templates/archery/competitions.html`

---

### 4. ✅ Subscription Status - Don't Auto-Confirm
**Problem**: Subscriptions were being created with status "confermato" (confirmed) instead of pending.

**Solution**:
- Changed default status from `'confermato'` to `'in attesa'` (pending)
- Admin must manually confirm subscriptions

**File**: `app/templates/archery/competitions.html`
```javascript
stato: 'in attesa',  // Pending - admin must confirm manually
```

---

### 5. ✅ Theme-Matched Athlete Dropdown
**Problem**: Athlete dropdown styling didn't match dark theme.

**Solution**:
- Added proper Tailwind classes for dark mode support
- Consistent styling with other form elements
- Added focus states and border colors

**File**: `app/templates/archery/competitions.html`
```javascript
select.className = 'w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 rounded-lg bg-white dark:bg-gray-700 text-gray-900 dark:text-white focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:border-primary';
```

---

### 6. ✅ Italian Date Formatting
**Problem**: Dates showing in English format (Oct-17) when Italian language selected.

**Solution**:
- Implemented custom Italian date formatting
- Format: `17-Ott-2025` for single dates
- Format: `17-18 Ott` for same-month ranges
- Format: `28 Ott - 2 Nov` for cross-month ranges
- Capitalizes month abbreviations in Italian

**Files**: `app/templates/archery/competitions.html`

**Examples**:
- Single date: `17 Ott`
- Same month: `17-18 Ott`
- Different months: `28 Ott - 2 Nov`

---

### 7. ✅ Added Athlete Preference Management
**Problem**: Users couldn't set default competition class (CO/OL/AN) and age category for their athletes.

**Solution**:
- Added "My Athletes" section to Settings page
- Users can set default class and category for each authorized athlete
- These defaults pre-populate when subscribing to competitions
- Real-time updates via PATCH API endpoint

**Files Modified**:
- `app/templates/auth/settings.html` - Added UI section
- `app/routes/api.py` - Added PATCH endpoint
- `translations/en.json` & `it.json` - Added translations

**New API Endpoint**:
```
PATCH /api/user/authorized-athletes/<athlete_id>
Body: { "classe": "CO", "categoria": "SM" }
```

**Fields**:
- **Classe** (Competition Class): CO (Compound), OL (Olimpico), AN (Arco Nudo)
- **Categoria** (Age Category): GM/GF, RM/RF, AM/AF, JM/JF, SM/SF, MM/MF

---

### 8. ✅ Translation Improvements
**Problem**: Several hardcoded English strings throughout the application.

**Solution**: Added missing translation keys

**New Keys Added** (both EN and IT):
- `common.optional` - "optional" / "facoltativo"
- `competitions.my_athletes` - "My Athletes" / "I Miei Atleti"
- `competitions.my_athletes_desc` - Description text
- `competitions.no_athletes` - "No authorized athletes" / "Nessun atleta autorizzato"
- `competitions.contact_admin` - Contact admin message
- `competitions.athlete_id` - "Athlete ID" / "ID Atleta"
- `competitions.competition_class` - "Competition Class" / "Classe di Gara"
- `competitions.default_preferences` - Preferences info text

**Files**: 
- `translations/en.json`
- `translations/it.json`

## API Changes

### New Endpoint
```http
PATCH /api/user/authorized-athletes/<athlete_id>
Authorization: Login required
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "classe": "CO",      // Optional: CO, OL, or AN
  "categoria": "SM"    // Optional: GM, GF, RM, RF, AM, AF, JM, JF, SM, SF, MM, MF
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "athlete": {
    "id": 1,
    "tessera": "12345",
    "classe": "CO",
    "categoria": "SM"
  }
}
```

**Security**: Endpoint verifies athlete belongs to current user before allowing updates.

---

## User Workflow Improvements

### Before
1. User selects competition
2. User selects athlete from dropdown
3. User must remember and enter class/category every time
4. Subscription created as "confirmed" immediately

### After
1. User sets default preferences in Settings → My Athletes
2. User selects competition
3. User selects athlete (themed dropdown)
4. Class/category auto-populated from athlete preferences
5. Subscription created as "pending" for admin review
6. Dates shown in localized format

---

## Database Fields

### AuthorizedAthlete Model
- `classe` (VARCHAR(10)) - Competition class: CO, OL, AN
- `categoria` (VARCHAR(10)) - Age category: GM, GF, RM, RF, AM, AF, JM, JF, SM, SF, MM, MF

**Note**: Migration should have been run to add these columns.

---

## Remaining Features (Not Implemented)

### 6. Show Competitions WITHOUT Invites + Interest Selection
**Status**: Not started
**Reason**: This requires:
- Backend API changes to expose inviti data
- New "interest" registration system separate from subscriptions
- Notification system for when invites are published
- More complex than other fixes

**Recommendation**: Implement in separate feature branch as it requires:
1. FastAPI endpoint for inviti data
2. New database table for interest registrations
3. Email notification system
4. Admin interface to publish invites

This is a larger feature that deserves dedicated planning and implementation.

4. **Git Sync**: Pull latest changes and rebuild container:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/mysite
   git pull
   docker-compose build --pull
   docker-compose up -d
