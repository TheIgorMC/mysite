# Cart & Notification System - Complete Fix

## üéØ Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Annoying Alert Popups
**Before:** Every action (add to cart, newsletter signup, errors) showed browser `alert()` popups
**After:** Beautiful, animated toast notifications that don't interrupt the user

### Problem 2: Cart Not Working
**Before:** Items added to cart never appeared in the cart page
**Root Cause:** Two different localStorage keys were being used:
- `addToCart()` saved to `'cart'`
- Cart page read from `'shopping_cart'`
**After:** Everything uses `'shopping_cart'` consistently

### Problem 3: Missing Product Information
**Before:** Cart only stored product ID, name, and price
**After:** Cart stores complete product data (image, description) for better display

## ‚ú® New Toast Notification System
Created a modern, animated toast notification system that replaces all `alert()` popups.

#### Features:
- ‚ú® **Smooth animations**: Slides in from the right, auto-dismisses
- üé® **4 notification types**: success (green), error (red), warning (yellow), info (blue)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Auto-dismiss**: Notifications disappear after 3 seconds
- üñ±Ô∏è **Manual close**: Click the X button to dismiss early
- üåô **Dark mode support**: Looks great in both light and dark themes
- üìö **Stackable**: Multiple notifications appear in a vertical stack
- üì± **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

#### Files Modified:
- `base.html`: Added toast container div in the header
- `main.js`: Added `showNotification()` function

---

### 2. **Fixed Cart Functionality**

#### The Problem:
The cart was using two different localStorage keys:
- `addToCart()` was saving to `'cart'`
- `cart.html` was reading from `'shopping_cart'`

This caused items to never appear in the cart page!

#### The Solution:
Updated `main.js` to use `'shopping_cart'` consistently:
```javascript
// Before:
localStorage.getItem('cart')

// After:
localStorage.getItem('shopping_cart')
```

---

### 3. **Replaced All Alerts with Notifications**

Updated all instances of `alert()` across the codebase:

#### main.js:
- ‚úÖ Product added to cart ‚Üí Success notification
- ‚úÖ Newsletter success ‚Üí Success notification
- ‚úÖ Newsletter error ‚Üí Error notification

#### archery-analysis.js:
- ‚úÖ Athlete already selected ‚Üí Warning notification
- ‚úÖ Max athletes reached ‚Üí Warning notification
- ‚úÖ Select at least one ‚Üí Warning notification

#### cart.html:
- ‚úÖ Checkout coming soon ‚Üí Info notification
