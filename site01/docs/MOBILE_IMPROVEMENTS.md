# Mobile UI Improvements

## Overview
This document details the mobile-specific improvements made to enhance the user experience on smaller screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Spinner Animation Fixed** ✅
**Issue**: Spinners were not spinning in both mobile and desktop
**Solution**: 
- Added `.animate-spin` class to CSS with proper `@keyframes` animation
- File: `site01/app/static/css/style.css`

```css
.animate-spin {
    animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}
```

### 2. **Dark Mode Hamburger Menu** ✅
**Issue**: Hamburger menu icon and mobile navigation links were dark gray in dark mode
**Solution**:
- Updated hamburger button: `text-gray-700` → `text-gray-700 dark:text-white`
- Updated mobile nav links: `text-gray-700` → `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200`
- Updated hover states: `hover:text-blue-600` → `hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-400`
- File: `site01/app/templates/base.html`

### 3. **Home Page Section Images Resized** ✅
**Issue**: Section images (archery, 3D printing, electronics) were too large on mobile
**Solution**:
- Changed image height from fixed `h-80` to responsive `h-64 md:h-80`
- Mobile: 256px (h-64)
- Desktop: 320px (h-80 - unchanged)
- File: `site01/app/templates/index.html`

### 4. **About Me Section Spacing** ✅
**Issue**: "About Me" section had too much blank space underneath and was positioned too high
**Solution**:
- Reduced padding: `py-16` → `py-12 md:py-16`
- Made heading responsive: `text-4xl` → `text-3xl md:text-4xl`
- Made text responsive: `text-lg` → `text-base md:text-lg`
- File: `site01/app/templates/index.html`

### 5. **Shop Page Mobile Filtering** ✅
**Issue**: Category filter buttons were cramped and hard to use on mobile
**Solution**:
- Desktop: Horizontal button group (unchanged)
- Mobile: Full-width dropdown select menu
- Uses Tailwind `hidden md:inline-flex` and `md:hidden` for responsive visibility
- Dropdown includes all categories with proper onChange handler
- File: `site01/app/templates/shop/index.html`

### 6. **Archery Analysis Date Inputs** ✅
**Issue**: Start and end date inputs were too close together on mobile
**Solution**:
- Changed layout from `grid-cols-2 gap-2` to `flex items-center gap-2`
- Added visual separator: `-` dash between date inputs
- Made inputs smaller with `text-sm` class
- File: `site01/app/templates/archery\analysis.html`

Before:
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <input type="date" ... class="px-4 py-2 ...">
    <input type="date" ... class="px-4 py-2 ...">
</div>
```

After:
```html
<div class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <input type="date" ... class="flex-1 px-3 py-2 text-sm ...">
    <span class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium">-</span>
    <input type="date" ... class="flex-1 px-3 py-2 text-sm ...">
</div>
```

### 7. **Chart Zoom and Pan (Mobile & Desktop)** ✅
**Issue**: Graph was hard to use on mobile - couldn't zoom or pan
**Solution**:
- Added Chart.js zoom plugin via CDN
- Added Hammer.js for touch gesture support
- Configured zoom options:
  - Desktop: Mouse wheel zoom, Ctrl+drag to pan
  - Mobile: Pinch to zoom, touch drag to pan
- Added "Reset Zoom" button that appears when chart has data
- Added helpful instruction text below chart (responsive messages)
- Files:
  - `site01/app/templates/base.html` - Added plugin scripts
  - `site01/app/templates/archery/analysis.html` - Added reset button and instructions
  - `site01/app/static/js/archery-analysis.js` - Configured zoom/pan, added reset functions

**Chart.js Zoom Configuration**:
```javascript
plugins: {
    zoom: {
        pan: {
            enabled: true,
            mode: 'xy',
            modifierKey: 'ctrl', // Desktop: hold Ctrl to pan
        },
        zoom: {
            wheel: {
                enabled: true,
                speed: 0.1
            },
            pinch: {
                enabled: true  // Mobile: pinch to zoom
            },
            mode: 'xy',
        }
    }
}
```

**New Functions Added**:
- `resetChartZoom()` - Resets chart to original view
- `showResetZoomButton()` - Shows reset button when chart has data
- `hideResetZoomButton()` - Hides reset button when chart is empty
