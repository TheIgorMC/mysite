## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. Admin searches for athlete
   ↓
2. Frontend → FastAPI GET /api/atleti?q=nome
   ↓
3. Results displayed (excluding already assigned)
   ↓
4. Admin clicks "Add"
   ↓
5. Frontend → Flask POST /admin/api/authorized-athletes
   ↓
6. Flask inserts into authorized_athletes table
   ↓
7. Success → reload user's athletes
   ↓
8. User can now subscribe this athlete to competitions
```

---

## 🎯 Integration with Competitions

Once an athlete is assigned to a user:

1. User logs in
2. Goes to **Archery → Competitions**
3. Clicks **"Subscribe"** on a competition
4. Sees dropdown with their authorized athletes:
   - `ABC123 - Mario Rossi`
   - `ABC124 - Luigi Verdi`
5. Selects athlete and turn
6. Subscription created in FastAPI with that athlete's tessera

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Update FastAPI URL
In `manage_athletes.html`, line ~285:
```javascript
const ARCHERY_API_BASE = 'http://localhost:80/api';  // Your FastAPI URL
```

### Admin Access Required
Only users with `is_admin=True` can access this page. To make a user admin:
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE username = 'your_username';
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No athletes found" | Check FastAPI is running at configured URL |
| Can't access page | Ensure user has `is_admin=True` in database |
| Athletes not loading | Verify `/api/atleti` endpoint works in FastAPI |
| Add button not working | Check browser console for errors, verify API endpoint |
| Changes not saving | Check Flask database write permissions |
